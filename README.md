**2. Gameplay Overview:**

* **Main Character:** The player’s avatar carries a tray that can hold up to 6 items at once.

* **Customer Orders:** Each customer will have a specific order, which could be a combination of pizza and drinks.
* **Tasks:**
  * The player must retrieve drinks from the fridge and pizzas from the counter.
  * Orders must be served promptly and accurately to maximize earnings.
